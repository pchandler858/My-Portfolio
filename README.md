The navigation bar is located at the top right corner of the page. It includes three links to different sections of the page, namely "ABOUT ME," "PROJECTS," and "CONTACT."

### Hero Section

The hero section is the first section that the user sees when they load the website. It features a jumbotron with a heading and a call-to-action button labeled "Learn Why." The jumbotron is designed with a gradient effect.

### About Section

The about section gives a brief introduction of myself, including my interests, background, and experience. It includes a picture of me, a short bio, and a link to my resume.

### Project Section

The project section showcases some of my projects. It features a section heading labeled "Projects" and three cards, each describing a different project. Each card includes a project title, a brief description, and a "See Project" button that links to the project's live site or repository.

### Contact Section

The contact section features a contact form that users can fill out to get in touch with me. The form includes fields for the user's name, email address, subject, and message. Additionally, the section includes links to my social media profiles, including LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter.

Its modern design and clear navigation make it easy for users to learn about me and view my projects. The inclusion of a contact form and links to social media profiles makes it easy for potential employers or clients to get in touch with me.
